You can define tasks that must be complete before content is published. Do you get a red X or a green checkmark?

== Description ==

[PublishPress Checklists](https://publishpress.com/checklists/) is the best plugin to make sure your content is ready to go live. With PublishPress Checklists, you can choose pre-publishing requirements for your content. Using PublishPress Checklists, you define tasks that must be completed before content is published.

Let's show you a few possible options for your posts:

* Ensure your posts have a minimum or maximum number of words.
* Require your posts have a featured image.
* Check for any broken links.
* Force authors to use a specific number of Tags or Categories.
* Require posts to be approved by a user in a specific role.
* Use OpenAI to scan your content and make sure it uses good grammar or the correct tone.

Next to every post and page, writers see a checklist box, showing the tasks they need to complete. Tasks can either be recommended or required. As authors complete each task, the red X automatically turns to a green checkmark.

PublishPress Checklists integrates with OpenAI. You can use OpenAI technology to scan your posts and check for the right tone, good spelling, or correct grammar.

## You Can Set These Checklist Requirements

Each task on your pre-publish checklist can be configured to meet your site’s needs. You can also set maximum and minimum values.

[Read the Getting Started guide for PublishPress Checklists](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/checklists-started/).

Here are the default tasks you can use on your checklists:

* **Title**: Maximum or minimum number of characters
* **Body text**: Maximum or minimum number of words
* **Categories**: Maximum or minimum number of categories
* **Tags**: Maximum or minimum number of tags
* **Taxonomy terms**: Maximum or minimum number of terms
* **Excerpt**: Maximum or minimum number of characters
* **Internal links**: Maximum or minimum number of internal links
* **External links**: Maximum or minimum number of external links
* **Featured image**: Require a featured image

* **Broken links**: Check that all links use a valid format
* **Permalink**: Control the characters in the URL
* **User approval**: Require that posts are approved by users in a specific role
* **Yoast SEO**: Require that posts get Yoast SEO approval

You can configure each requirement, depending on whether you want to require writers to complete the tasks. Here are the three options:

* Disabled
* Recommended
* Required

If you choose the “Required” option, it will be impossible to publish without completing the task.

## OpenAI Checklist Requirements

PublishPress Checklists integrates with OpenAI. You can use prompts to analyze your content. If OpenAI decides that your content doesn't meet the requirements, it will show the task as incomplete.

You can create checklist requirements like these:</p>

* "Is the content clear and easy to read?"
* "Is this content tone professional?"
* "Does this article use correct grammar?"

OpenAI will scan your content and given a detailed verdict. This is an excellent way to catch errors and improve your content before publishing.

[Click here to see how to create OpenAI requirements](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/custom-requirements-checklist/).

## You Can Create New Checklist Requirements

You can create new requirements for your checklists by clicking the “Add custom task” link. For example, you can require authors to get a green Yoast sign, or force them to run a spell-check before publishing.

[Click here to see how to create custom requirements](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/custom-requirements-checklist/).

It is also possible to create more powerful requirements using a custom plugin. We have created a sample plugin to show how to do this. The sample plugin will automatically check that your site’s authors have included a specific word in their main content. If this new requirement is enabled, it will automatically search the text of your content to make sure it contains the word you choose.

= Can I check that all my links are valid? =

With the PublishPress Checklists plugin, you can ensure that all the links in your content (both external and internal) use a valid link format. This feature won't check the destination URL, but it will check the link format to make sure you haven't used URLs such as htpps// or .nt.

The Checklists plugin uses these regular expressions to check for broken links. You will find this code in this file: /core/Utils/HyperlinkValidator.php.

With the PublishPress Checklists plugin, you can require that all the images have ALT text in your WordPress content. If an image is missing the ALT text, you can choose to show a warning, or prevent the post from being published.

* Go to Checklists > Settings.
* You can choose from “Disabled, Recommended, or Required” options.
* You can choose “Who can ignore this task?“

With the PublishPress Checklists plugin, you can require that all your posts have a Featured image.

Many sites require a featured image for blog posts because an image is important for sharing on social media.

* You can choose from “Disabled, Recommended, or Required” options.
* You can choose “Who can ignore this task?"
* If you enable this Featured image option, it will be visible when you edit content. If your Featured image box is empty, this task will be marked in red in the sidebar. If your Featured image box has an image, this task will be marked in green in the sidebar.

[Read about requiring a featured image](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/featured-image/)

= Can I require all posts to be approved by an administrator? =

* Go to Checklists > Settings.
* You can choose from “Disabled, Recommended, or Required” options.
* You can choose “Who can ignore this task?“
* In the final box, you can choose which roles can approve posts. If a user is in one of the selected roles, they will see a checkbox. If the user approves the post, they can check the box and the content can be published.
